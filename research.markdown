## Research

My research sits at the dynamic intersection of Condensed Matter Physics (CMP), Optics, and Quantum Science. I am dedicated to pioneering innovative protocols that exploit the spatial and temporal correlations among diverse quantum systems. This pursuit aims to unlock insights into the correlated dynamics within strongly interacting condensed matter systems. Simultaneously, I am driven to explore how these understandings can propel advancements in quantum technologies. By delving into the intricate interplay of quantum phenomena, my work seeks not only to deepen our comprehension of fundamental physics but also to push the boundaries of practical applications. I am particularly interested in bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and experimental implementations, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques to explore novel quantum phenomena. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and a relentless pursuit of discovery, I aim to contribute to both the theoretical foundations and practical realizations of quantum technologies, ushering in a new era of scientific innovation and technological advancement.
